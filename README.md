# Loft-farm-automation
The world around us is getting automated day by day with the advent of technology. Because of tiring the manual labor, automated systems are being favored. As other types of farming , Pigeon farm also can be done using the system to yield more comfortable environment and for more  production. In pigeon farming, to protect the fit racing pigeon from losing form temperature in the farm must be above 10 and below 30 degree Celsius, and the humidity kept below 65% . These are the conditions that favor continuing health and known as the Thermo-Neutral zone for the pigeon. In this project we are going to develop a system that will control the lights and blower fan as required temperature and humidity including the desired time. Alongside we also try to implement a password based security system for the farmhouse.
